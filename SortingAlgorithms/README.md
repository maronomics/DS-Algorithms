# Sorting Algorithms

A Sorting Algorithm is used to rearrange a given array or list elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. (GeeksforGeeks).

Purpose of this Repo is to learn the basic principle of different sorting algorithms, and look at the use cases. It will also serve as the base to build an application for visualising the sorting algorithms using Node.js.
